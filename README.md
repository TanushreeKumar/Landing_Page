# Landing_Page
This project is a modern, responsive online flower shop website built using HTML and CSS. It is designed to give users a visually appealing experience while browsing flowers, learning about the shop, and exploring available collections.

The website currently has two main sections:
- Landing Page – A welcoming page that introduces the flower shop, highlights its offerings, and provides quick navigation.

- Shop Page – A product display section where flowers and bouquets are showcased in a clean, user-friendly layout.
